#Standing questions:
#What to do with ActiveForm statements. Sometimes seems like it may be relevant/useful (GRB2) but could be bypassed. Sometimes seems like a negative (AKT). Likely should filter out in first steps.
#Still need a break point on catalytic reactions. EGFR-AKT-beyond is the testcase here. If Phosphorylation(EGFR,AKT) don't want this context carried forward, ie don't want Akt to require egfr binding, but do want Akt phos. This probably plays back into active form. Probably need to figure it out/consult ben but don't want to deal with that.
