EGFR-Akt direct connection?
[Evidence(reach, 25000176, {'found_by': 'Phosphorylation_syntax_1a_noun'}, Phosphorylation of downstream signaling molecules phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (PKB or Akt) by activated EGFR promotes cell proliferation XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR.),
 Evidence(reach, 12532415, {'found_by': 'Phosphorylation_syntax_3_noun'}, In contrast, inhibition of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) blocked the constitutive phosphorylation of Erk and AKT-1 but not the EGFR.)]

Clearly skipping PI3K but maybe that's okay


count how many observables remain
specifically, are there proteins of the observable list that are missing phosphorylation sites observed?

Already:
Iteration   3:  3900 species   6971 rxns  8.78e+00 CPU s
Then crash


Ways to reduce complexity:
check mod/muts but they look minimal at first glance
    -none to remove
check dimers
    -EGFR,GRB2, mtor on mTORC1 site?
    -remove grb2 and mtor for now, leave egfr since grb2 binding relies on egfr dimer
    -can revist egfr if needed, make grb2 binding dependent on egf binding or phos, have to add one or both
    -grb2 and mtor done, didn't break any other rules.
    -egfr done. Made egfr-grb2 binding context independent. Can add back complexity later
    -still: Iteration   3:  2078 species   4279 rxns  4.12e+00 CPU s


binding context - how many instances of random binding, when upstream binding is needed first. can create lots of unlikely  

Focus on ras part of the pathway for now

POTENTIAL MAJOR FLAW
    will akt portion of the pathway currently be affected by any of the drugs?
    MEK inhibitor probably most challenging, ignore for now
    dirty drug may be easiest to get a perturbation, but most difficult to model
    RAF1 may give some entry point. Not sure what that interaction with AKT is abou
    Otherwise need some real cross talk between pathways

Additional context concerns:
    -mtor and associated complexes in general is off, mtor itself missing key phos. 
    -why dose mtor phosphorylate S6, instead of S6K?

    -akt/mtor path to shoot for
    akt activates mtorc1 (doesn't bind directly but whatever)
    mtorc1 activates s6k1 (is this direct phosphorylation)
    s6k phosphorylates s6
    s6 inhibits mtorc2 (direct phosphorylation?)
    mtorc2 phosphorylates and activates akt3

    original activation of akt should probably be rec->pi3k->pip3->mtorc2->akt (and this hits S473)
    Currently have rec -> akt
    can settle for rec->mtorc2->akt (misses pten feedback :( )

Ways to add back in observales:
Many were in the first model I made, that had faulty BE filtering
Can potentially add back in small sets of rules from that model
Best of both worlds, accuracy from strict filtering, some expansion from weak filtering, without having to do wide scale accuracy checking of evertying in the model
only have to check small number of rules re-introduced
