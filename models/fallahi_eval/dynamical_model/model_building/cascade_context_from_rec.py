#this has to follow rec_lig finding
#everything binding to rec will have ligand context
#continue to carry this down cascade
#every complex reaction must have first ag bound to rec/other adaptor to allow 2nd ag binding
#This will build complexes, phosphorylations should be break points
#have to watch for redundant complex/phosphorylation statments which will allow binding that isn't breaking the complex incorrectly
#this should be taken care of by the mech linker/preassebler but a couple seemed to slip through, not sure why.
